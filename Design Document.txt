Fiefdom
The player assumes the place of a lord of a fiefdom and tries to rise to control the kingdom.

The town is presented in a 2d side view.
The castle is in the center and the buildings around the outer sides.
You can't go out too far past the edges of the castle until an upgrade is purchased/the forest is cleared of monsters.

You build and upgrade buildings with the ultimate goal of becoming king of the fiefdoms.

Once you raise to a high enough title you can call for a vote for the king and there will be one last election for the kingship.

There is a high council that votes on matters and there votes can be swayed by influence of the fiefdoms.
Each high councilor will be loyal to the one who holds the most sway with them. They count for a large vote.

!!Stretch: Quests are given (AKA resources in certain time) to give boosts in standing, Also an option would be to have a blind bid for control.

Some buildings in the fiefdoms will grant support from the people, they will act like votes during voting sessions.
Proposals can be earned, crafted or bought. They are used to propose a vote for many different things.

Some random item come up to be voted upon.

!!Stretch: The items up for vote are build dynamically with how the players play.

!!Stretch: Council members will have a personality that will make them vote certain ways.
